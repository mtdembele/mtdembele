I'm a senior (graduating December 2025) studying cybersecurity at the George Washington University 🦛, an NSA/DHS National Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity. I transitioned into cybersecurity after earning my associate's degree in computer science from Montgomery College. I'm interested in problem-solving and technology, and as I continue to develop my cybersecurity expertise, I will revisit programming to expand my knowledge. Outside university studies, I am completing the Hack the Box SOC Analyst path. In my free time, I enjoy grappling and combat sports 🥋, gaming 🎮, language learning 💬 (French and Arabic), and literature 📚.
